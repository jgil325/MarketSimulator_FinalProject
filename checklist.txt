Checklist of what completed

	Effort Level: This was harder than expected, harder than homeworks.
	Having to incorporate IBonds was extremely difficult as I had to come up with the
	way to do it myself. Eventually, I settled on manually editing a csv file for each
	dollar value of portfolio needed to be IBonds, and then in my order csv files, I
	would "buy" 1 stock of that Ibond whose price I manipulated to act like it would
	pay out interest twice a year every 6 months.
